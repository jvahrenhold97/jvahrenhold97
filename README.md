# Welcome to Jan Vahrenhold's GitHub-profile!
## About me
My name is Jan Vahrenhold and I am a student of the masters programme "Geo-Data-Technology" at [Technische Hochschule Würzburg-Schweinfurt (THWS)](https://www.thws.de). Before that, I finished my bachelors degree in "Geovisualization" at the THWS.
While studying I have always tried to find new opportunities to work with Geo-data which has led me to my current role as working student at [topodat](https://www.topodat.de). Now I am taking my first steps in the field of data science, specializing
in working with Geo-data. If you'd like to learn more about me, visit my website at [vahrenhol3d.de](https://www.vahrenhol3d.de).
